	<p><small>*Given the lesser drive to expand one’s social interactions beyond an existing circle, hook ups will be with
friends or friendly acquaintances far more than with strangers or people met at parties, etc. This goes along
with the thoughtfulness and quiet confidence that is so fashionable.<br />
**Before, it was in to be aware of one’s own troped being. This involves a partially false performance or
insecurity. Sticking to a trope was a way of coping with insecurity with tru individuality.<br />
***The social focus is inward or at least more immediate. People are/will be less occupied with expansion or
climbing and more with awareness of their own position and what it means in relation to others and their
actions. By being ironically aware of this, people were able to at once deal with this while expressing their self-awareness. Now, this is out and being quietly original is IN. This easily relates to “self-branding as a
by-product”<br />

^Greys, beiges, periwinkle, etc. Because black as a statement is out and it’s summer, people will veer
towards these soft neutrals. The art of coupling them with a color is also in AND should not be avoided out
of fear bc such fear is OUT.<br />
^^Refer to Eggsthetics facebook group <br />
^^^This can be related to the uprising of quick DIY food videos on Facebook as well as the non-necessity of
being frivolous. Frivolity and whimsicality are out. Frivolity is, however, more grounded because action is a
feature of it. Frivolity = whimsicality + action. Whimsicality is more out. HOWEVER, shitting on people for
enjoying things like expensive avocado toast is out. Please refer to opening essay!<br />
